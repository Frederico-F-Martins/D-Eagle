**The Discord Eagle (D'Eagle) is a Python (Scrapy + Discord.py) Amazon price checker that sends you a discord message when price decreases.**

---
## Usage

1-  I suggest you create a new discord bot just for this script. You will have to allow "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" for the bot to work.

2-  Select the three specific variables before running the script:

> discordID - Discord id (from dev mode) that you want the bot to send the price drop warning;
> bot_token - Token required to log into your discord bot;
> item_url - Amazon URL for the item you want to follow.

3- Run it with Python3. The bot will check the price every 12 hours if it is left permanently running.
